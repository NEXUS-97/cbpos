The project, Cosmetics, and beauty products online shop Management system, is a web-based application that allows the manager
to handle all the activities online.This system is proposed to replace the manual system of True Beauty. Our team have 
identified the problems faced by the client up to the present. we have analyzed and sorted out the needed requirements and 
how it is to be done.  In this system we are going to develop a facility which will be very helpful to the manager on the
other hand to the customer as they would be able to get good and fast service. This system helps the factory in better
